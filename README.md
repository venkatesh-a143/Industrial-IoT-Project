Aim : To design and simulate an automated irrigation system using Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT) that 
monitors soil moisture and environmental conditions, and triggers irrigation only when 
necessary—thereby optimizing water usage in agricultural fields.

Results : The simulation demonstrated that the system successfully monitors soil moisture and 
controls irrigation: 
• Sprinkler activates when soil moisture falls below the threshold (e.g., < 5 cm water level). 
• Sprinkler deactivates when soil moisture rises above the threshold (e.g., > 10 cm water 
level). 
• Real-time monitoring via Smart Phone interface was achieved. 
• The system ensured reduced water wastage and efficient irrigation in the simulation 
environment.
